# Project Overview

We are analyzing temperature trends in Oahu to determine the viability of a surf and ice cream shop on a year-round basis. To do this we are looking particualrly at temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, this will help us determine if the business is sustainable year-round. The source data for this analysis comes from file: hawaii.sqlite. Then we used Python, Pandas functions and methods, SQLAlchemy, and SQLlite to conduct the analysis. 

# Results

Below we are presenting the summary statistics calculated for June and December and then hihglihting the mayor differences found.
